I'm a quantitative ecologist solving challenging problems related to conservation and sustainable use of Earth's ecosystems. I use mathematical, statistical and spatial models to provide a robust evidence-base for decision-makers faced with difficult choices, such as how to set [scientifically-sound targets for mangrove and seagrass conservation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982222002354). To engage and inform end-users I develop web tools, e.g., [this tool for exploring data related to conservation of the world's Blue Forest ecosystems]( https://cbuelow.shinyapps.io/blue-forests-application/).

Find out more on the [Research](research/index.qmd), [Outreach & Teaching](outreach/index.qmd), and [Tools](tools/index.qmd) pages.

Currently, I'm a Post-doctoral Researcher with the [Thriving Oceans Research Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/our-research/research-areas/geosciences/marine-geosciences/thriving-oceans-research-hub.html) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). Previously I was a Research Fellow with the [Global Wetlands Project](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/).
