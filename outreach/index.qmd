## Geospatial community

I'm an active organising committee member for [Geospatial Share](https://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/). Our mission is to build a **supportive and inclusive** community where students, researchers, and professionals can grow their geospatial skills together. We run virtual workshops to learn techniques in spatial data science.
