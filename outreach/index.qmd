## Geospatial community

I'm an active organising committee member for the [Geospatial Community](https://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/). We run virtual workshops to learn techniques in spatial data science.

## Programming

I enjoy teaching and, in addition to tutoring and guest lecturing, I have developed and taught tutorials in spatial data science programming such as this [intro to R spatial](https://cabuelow.quarto.pub/r-for-mapping-and-more/) and this [intro to RShiny](https://github.com/cabuelow/intro-rshiny-mapping). Watch the youtube recording of the workshop [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBoQ0rcY_NU&t=2152s).

I also help teach quantitative methods in the R programming language in an annual 5-day workshop, [sign up for the next event in February 2024](https://smp.uq.edu.au/events).
