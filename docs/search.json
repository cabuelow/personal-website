I use models - spatial, statistical, mathematical - to provide a robust evidence-base for decision-makers faced with difficult choices, such as how to set scientifically-sound targets for mangrove and seagrass conservation. To engage and inform end-users I develop web tools, e.g., this tool for exploring data related to conservation of the world’s Blue Forest ecosystems.\nFind out more on the Research and Outreach & Teaching pages.\nCurrently, I’m a Research Fellow with the Global Wetlands Project at Griffith University.\nGet in touch."

However, useful forecasts of ecosystem change can be challenging to make the global scale, particularly with coarse datasets that are unable to capture processes operating at fine spatial scales.\nIn collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund, we’re developing novel approaches for forecasting the future of mangroves at the global scale when data of fine spatio-temporal resolution is limited."

    "text": "Conservation Theories of Change\n‘Theories of Change’ are a tool for planning conservation strategies, and define how actions will lead to desired socio-ecological outcomes. Theories of Change could be made more robust through explicit integration of enabling conditions, and via more rigorous testing and adaptation with causal theory and ecosystem models. I’m interested in using models and validation techniques to make global-scale mapping of conservation priorities and their Theories of Change more robust. I’m lucky to collaborate with a diverse team of experts, including environmental lawyers, to do so."
