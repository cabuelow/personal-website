I use models - spatial, statistical, mathematical - to provide a robust evidence-base for decision-makers faced with difficult choices, such as how to set scientifically-sound targets for mangrove and seagrass conservation. To ensure that research can reach end-users, I also develop web-tools to enable engagement, e.g., this tool for exploring data that can inform conservation of the world’s Blue Forest ecosystems.\nFind out more on the Research page.\nCurrently, I’m a Research Fellow with the Global Wetlands Project at Griffith University.\nGet in touch."

    "text": "Conservation Theories of Change\n‘Theories of Change’ are a tool for planning conservation strategies, and define how actions will lead to desired socio-ecological outcomes. Theories of Change could be made more robust through explicit integration of enabling conditions, and via more rigorous testing and adaptation with causal theory and ecosystem models. I’m interested in using models and validation techniques to make global-scale mapping of conservation priorities and their Theories of Change more robust."
