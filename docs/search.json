    "text": "Photo credit: Benjamin L. Jones on Unsplash Note: See another version of this blog post on Nature Community’s ‘Behind the Paper’ series.\nIf you look closely at the image above, you’ll see someone fishing behind a dense seagrass meadow. How can we ensure that seagrass habitats will continue to thrive and support sustainable fisheries into the future?\nEarlier this year, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF) was adopted to support just and sustainable use of the Earth’s ecosystems. The overall goal is to secure exactly what we see in the image of coastal seagrass fisheries by the year 2050 - a future where humans live in harmony with nature.\nHowever, it is not clear how we can coordinate actions, locally and globally, to achieve this. The ‘theory of change’ is unclear.\nA robust theory of change must consider the socioeconomic and political factors that allow actions to be successfully implemented - known as ‘enabling conditions’. For example, national policy is unlikely to lead to successful outcomes if governance is ineffective.\nOur paper provides a framework for operationalising global theories of change, such as the KM-GBF, in three steps - outlined in the figure below.\n\nIn these steps, enabling conditions directly underpin conservation implementation pathways through the concept of ‘enabling profiles’. Enabling profiles classify nations according to indicators representing their socioeconomic and political capacity for sustainably managing and conserving ecosystems.\nTo demonstrate the approach, we developed enabling profiles for coastal ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems - seagrass, mangroves, and saltmarsh - to inform nested theories of change for their conservation. The figure below highlights some key examples, but case-studies can also be explored interactively with this web application.\n\nAlthough our blue carbon case study only considers national-scale enabling conditions, sub-national enabling profiles could also be established to inform multi-scale and localised theories of change that underpin National Biodiversity and Strategy Action Plans (NBSAPs) - the primary mechanism by which action towards the KM-GBF will be coordinated.\nCoordinating actions across nations will be key to achieving targets of the KM-GBF and the Sustainable Development Goals. Our framework can be applied to other ecosystems to help to coordinate actions, and ensure they are effective given socioeconomic and political context.\nLet’s synergise efforts to achieve our common goals, such as sustainable fisheries supported by healthy seagrass habitat by the year 2050 and beyond.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{buelow2023,\n  author = {Buelow, Christina},\n  title = {Theories of Change for Living in Harmony with Nature},\n  pages = {undefined},\n  date = {2023-11-12},\n  url = {https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2023-11-12-new-paper/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBuelow, Christina. 2023. “Theories of Change for Living in Harmony\nwith Nature.” November 12, 2023. https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2023-11-12-new-paper/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Early this year I sat down to start developing a mathematical model to inform the rates at which mangroves need to be protected and/or restored to achieve ecosystem service targets. I started with a simple schematic of the model - how will different coastal landscape states (e.g., protected forest vs. unprotected deforested areas) transition through time, and what processes cause these transitions?\nFor me, this often looks like chicken scratch…\n\n\n\nBrainstorming and conceptualising…\n\n\nOnce I had the conceptual model, I started writing out the maths to model the transitions through time. Rather than doing this on paper, I chose to write it in Quarto so that I program the model as I was writing the maths.\nQuarto is a nice tool that allows you to write markdown and make beautiful webpages very quickly that contain richly formatted text, program code, and code output (e.g., plots and graphs). It allowed me to set model parameters and test my model as I programmed it and visualise model output to make sure the model and code was working as expected. I planned to send a .html version of the doc to collaborators so that they could see exactly how the model was developed and what the expected outputs would be.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of standard Quarto doc combinging images, text, code, and code output\n\n\nSomewhere along the way, however, I started turning the Quarto doc into a shiny app. The main benefit of a shiny app over a standard Quarto doc was the ability to change all of the 20+ model parameters across their ranges, quickly re-run the model, and visualise the model output almost instantly. The shiny app is able to react to changes is model parameters, whereas the standard Quarto is not reactive (note however you can easily embed shiny apps in Quarto docs (which is what I did), or use ObservableJS so you don’t need to host the web app on a server).\n\nPlay with the app here\nThis turned out to be a really fun way to develop a model because I got to see what the model was doing every time I added something new. Also, because I was able to fully explore model outputs across the entire parameter space as I developed the model, I was able to more quickly discover and correct bugs.\nI’m hoping the app will also become a tool for communicating with stakeholders, as now that it is a reactive web app, anyone can explore the model without needing programming software on their computer to run it.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{buelow2024,\n  author = {Buelow, Christina},\n  title = {Building Better Models with Reactive Applications},\n  pages = {undefined},\n  date = {2024-02-10},\n  url = {https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2024-02-10-apps-explore-models/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBuelow, Christina. 2024. “Building Better Models with Reactive\nApplications.” February 10, 2024. https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2024-02-10-apps-explore-models/."

    "text": "The comics in this post are thanks to the excellent xkcd, see them here and here.\n\n\n\nEpistemic uncertainty\n\n\nLife is full of uncertainties. Ironically, this is probably one of the few things that we can truly be certain about. Uncertainty is a consequence of the fact that a) we don’t know everything and b) we can’t control everything.\nAs an ecological modeller, I think about uncertainty and it’s causes and consequences all the time. In fact, a big part of my job is quantifying uncertainty; for instance, how precise is our estimate of the relationship between temperature and species richness?\nLast year, myself and collaborators spent a lot of time thinking about how mis-matches in the spatio-temporal resolution of data available to estimate ecological relationships, like the response of mangroves to sea-level rise, translate to forecast uncertainty. Sea-level rises at rates of millimeters per year. How can we model the future response of mangroves to this process when most digital elevation models have errors of up to +/- metres? It seemed an impossible task, especially at the global scale.\nSo, we opted to embrace uncertainty. We accepted that we would not be able to parameterise the processes in our global forecasting models with the accuracy and precision required to make quantitative forecasts of extent change.\nInstead, we used probabilitsitc forecasts to identify where in the world we are certain mangroves will either persist or be lost in the future. This involved using simulation to randomly parameterise models representing the response of mangroves to interacting climatic and anthropogenic pressures, allowing us to calculate the future probability of mangrove net loss or gain.\nWe also cross-validated our model’s hindcasts across the entire global extent of mangroves, allowing us to propagate prediction error as uncertainty in the number of forests forecast to either persist or be lost in the future.\nIf you’re keen to check out our approach and decide what you think for yourself, see the pre-print here.\n\n\n\nPropagating uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{buelow2024,\n  author = {Buelow, Christina},\n  title = {Uncertainty},\n  pages = {undefined},\n  date = {2024-02-11},\n  url = {https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2024-02-11-new-preprint/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBuelow, Christina. 2024. “Uncertainty.” February 11, 2024.\nhttps://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2024-02-11-new-preprint/."

This is the generation that is going to see us through to a truly sustainable future, and they need to be given opportunities like this to lead us there.\nThe group is going to continue working together to refine their perspective on key priorities for sustaining ocean and coastal ecosystems, and publish this as a way to kick-start action.\nIn the meantime I wanted to share a few key take-aways I had:\n\nWe won’t achieve our sustainability goals without multi-disciplinary, collaborative action,\nThis requires open minds and a willingness to step out of our comfort zones and learn from each other\nAnd, most importantly:\n\nResearchers need to do more than publish papers. We need to take a more active role in policy by volunteering as either expert reviewers or as contributing authors to policy documents. This means seeking out these opportunities, putting our hands up to get involved, (probably) experiencing some rejection, but eventually having some influence.\nSidenote, this also means University leadership needs to recognise that getting involved is just as important as publishing papers. ECRs are under immense pressure to publish a lot, very quickly.\nScience would have a better chance at informing a sustainable future if ECRs were asked to focus on publishing research that can inform policy (i.e., asks the right questions), regardless of how long it takes to publish that research and how many publications it produces.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{buelow2024,\n  author = {Buelow, Christina},\n  title = {Sustainable {Oceans} and {Coasts}},\n  pages = {undefined},\n  date = {2024-03-03},\n  url = {https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2024-03-03-early-career-day/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBuelow, Christina. 2024. “Sustainable Oceans and Coasts.”\nMarch 3, 2024. https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2024-03-03-early-career-day/."

    "text": "Quarto ‘quick and dirty’ or {Golem} for longevity and complexity?\nAs expected in an open-source programming language, the app-making landscape in R seems to be in constant flux. Something newish that I’ve been finding useful lately is using Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’ feature.\nQuarto is very similar to Rmarkdown, but has a few additional features. One of them is the ability to embed R {shiny} apps. So you end up writing your app like you would a markdown doc - the context, ui, and server are all code chunks, and the text around those code chunks set’s up the UI. For example, normally in markdown we use # to delineate and navigate headers; in Quarto Shiny Dashboards, # are used to delineate pages, tab panels, etc.\nI’ve found it’s great for proto-typing simple apps - you can get something up and running very quickly in Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’. However, I think it could get unwieldy when you start building complex apps with modules etc. In that case, developing your {shiny} app as an R package with {golem} might be a better option. {golem} provides a great framework for engineering production grade shiny apps that are complex and can be easily maintained in the long-term.\nI ended up turning the prototype app I built in Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’ into an R package with {golem}. It took much longer than I expected, but much of that time was learning about R package development (which I had never done before) and {golem}.\nIn the end I think it was worth the extra time and effort streamline as an R package. But if you want to compare for yourself, find the protoype Quarto dashboard shiny here and the {golem} R package version here.\nCurious to hear others’ experiences though - please get in touch.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{buelow2024,\n  author = {Buelow, Christina},\n  title = {Web Apps in {R} - {To} Package or Not to Package?},\n  pages = {undefined},\n  date = {2024-04-19},\n  url = {https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2024-04-19-app-pros-cons/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBuelow, Christina. 2024. “Web Apps in R - To Package or Not to\nPackage?” April 19, 2024. https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/posts/2024-04-19-app-pros-cons/."
