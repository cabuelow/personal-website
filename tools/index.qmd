[Prioritising conservation actions](https://cbuelow.shinyapps.io/prioritise-actions/)

Apps can help us explore complex models as we develop them, and serve as helpful communication tools. This app is still under development, but it has allowed me to explore a model I'm developing for prioritising conservation actions for mangrove forests.

[Blue Forest Data Explorer](https://cbuelow.shinyapps.io/blue-forests-application/)

This app was built through a series of end-user engagement workshops to inform the World Wildlife Fund's Blue Forest Initiative's 10-year conservation strategy.

[Enabling profiles for operationalising global Theories of Change](https://cbuelow.shinyapps.io/enabling-profiles)

Explore enabling profiles for coastal wetland conservation and case-study Theories of Change.

[Set ambitious targets for mangrove and seagrass recovery](https://cbuelow.shinyapps.io/target-setting/)

This tool allows end-users to set global conservation targets and estimate the rates at which countries will need to protect and restore to achieve them.
